Consumer Complaint Resolution

Overview
This project analyzes consumer complaints to predict resolution outcomes using machine learning techniques. The dataset consists of consumer complaints submitted to relevant agencies, and the goal is to classify complaints based on their likelihood of resolution.

Features and Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, removed duplicates, and standardized text formats.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized complaint categories, frequency distributions, and resolution patterns.
Machine Learning Model: Implemented XGBoost for classification of complaint resolution status.
Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance.
Results and Conclusions
No explicit conclusions found in the notebook. If you have insights from the analysis, consider adding a summary of key findings.

Requirements
Python 3.x
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn, XGBoost
